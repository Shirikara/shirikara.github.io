I am Shiri, a Ph.D. student at the Weizmann Institute working on breast cancer and single-cell proteomics.<br> 
Analyzing human samples from the clinic makes me feel closer to the applicational opportunities of basic science.<br> 
- Data-driven person specializing in R, Python, and MATLAB.<be>
- 5+ years of experience in mass Spectrometry
- Part-time scientific writer at Davison Institute, believing that promoting science education is as important as being a scientist.<br> 
- I am a plant-lover üå±, and I enjoy practicing yoga. Since I have my own sourdough, "Tamagotchi," I haven't bought a bread loaf even once.<br>
