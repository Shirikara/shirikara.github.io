**Welcome to my webpage!** <br>
Hello, I am Shiri, a Ph.D. student at the Weizmann Institute working on breast cancer and single-cell proteomics with 5+ years of experience in mass Spectrometry. Analyzing human samples from the clinic makes me feel closer to the applicational opportunities of basic science. Data-driven person specializing in R, Python, and MATLAB. I am a part-time scientific writer at Davison Institute, believing that promoting science education is as important as being a scientist. I am a plant-lover, and I enjoy practicing yoga. Since I have my own sourdough, "Tamagotchi," I haven't bought a bread loaf even once.<br>
